    <h1>Welcome to my world</h1>

    <p>My name is Nason Mang'eli and I enjoy doing tons of different stuff. Here is a list (<strong>that I have divided into three parts</strong>) of all the cool stuff I love doing to make my life as awesome as it can get.</p>
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <p>I love staying in shape. With exercise and some mouth-watering food, I enjoy every second of it.</p>
    <p>Workouts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running</li>
      <li>Strength training</li>
      <li>Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (I know it's painful but it makes me feel accomplished :-))</li>
      <li>Swimming</li>
      <li>Playing rugby</li>
      <li>Most importantly is the <strong>endorphin rush</strong> I get when working out!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Food</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>Ugali</li>
      <li>Brown rice</li>
      <p>When I want alittle treat</p>
      <li>Custard cake</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Vanilla icecream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mind</h2>
    <p>I am a very curious person as such I enjoy expanding my mind. I dismantle things, just to see if I can put them back together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do It Yourself projects are also at the top of my list interms of mental activity. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-a-taser-for-free/">Here</a> is a link to one project I had fun doing <strong>(Take care it involves electricity!)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Coding. This helps me to learn how machines tick.</li>
      <li>Learning to play instruments.</li>
      <li>Science and science fiction</li>
      <li>Basically anything else that will get my neurons firing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Spirit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Meditation</li>
      <li>Helping others</li>
      <li>Going to church</li>
      <li>Going camping, being one with nature and appreciating life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apart from the above I also like spending time with my family and friends.</p>
    <p>There you go,those are some of the things that make my day.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoyed reading. Try some out!</p>
